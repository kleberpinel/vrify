Hello, Kleber here :)

Not so sure what you guys mean by "Submissions are to be in plain text format".
I've created a txt file for question #1 and #2.

- vrify_1.rb is a ruby file where you can execute the code. It could easily be applied to any Rails application
- vrify_2.sql is the query requested on the SQL question
- vrify_3_app.js is the app REST api
- vrify_3_app.test.js is the tests for the app REST api
- vrify_3_server.js is the actual server
