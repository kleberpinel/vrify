Hello, Kleber here :)

Not so sure what you guys mean by "Submissions are to be in plain text format".
I've created a txt file for question #1 and #2.

- vrify_1.txt is a ruby file where you can just rename to `.rb` and execute the code. It could easily be applied to any Rails application
- vrify_2.txt is the query requested to the SQL question
- vrify_3 folder has basically one file for the app and another for the test. if you run `npm install && npm test` (and have the db properly set), it should work.
